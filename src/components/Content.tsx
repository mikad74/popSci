        <h2>Queer Linguistic Resilience: English as a Safe Space</h2>
        <p className="date">Friday, May 26, 2023</p>
        <p>
          Growing up in Italy as a queer person, I noticed that it was quite
          common for me to use English or Italian-English code-switching with
          other Italian LGBTQ+ peers. This is striking when you discover that
          English is not commonly spoken as a second language, even by the
          younger generations. This would happen at school or in my free time,
          without me paying too much attention to the fact that I would only use
          English with queer people; in fact I just used to think that we all
          shared a spirit of international appreciation.
        </p>
        <p>
          During a year-long exchange in Finland when I was seventeen, I
          observed that I would converse in Finnish with most of my
          Finnish-speaking friends, reserving English for a few — again, the
          queer ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast-forward to a month ago, while taking a sociolinguistics class, a
          gay coursemate from Turkey shared a similar experience and I started
          asking myself: “Is this a worldwide phenomenon and am I only finding
          out about this now?”
        </p>
        <h5>Queerphobia and Colonialism</h5>
        <p>
          While investigating this topic, we found roots of colonialism in
          queerphobia. Contrary to outdated beliefs of a civilising West,
          colonialism has been proven to be damaging even in the case of queer
          freedoms, as mentioned by scholar
          <a
            href="https://www.cairn.info/revue-autrepart-2009-1-page-15.htm"

            {" "}
            Peter Jackson
          </a>
          . He observes that Thailand and Japan are the only East Asian
          countries where LGBTQ+ cultures developed in modern times and he
          relates it to the fact that they did not suffer direct colonisation.
          In contrast, in the case of Mongolia, which underwent Western
          colonisation through Soviet imperialism, these communities were
          prevented from sprouting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another example of queerphobia rooted in colonialism is found in Hong
          Kong, where homosexuality was criminalised by the British rulers. The
          stigma persists today to the point that queerness is portrayed as
          being contrary to
          <a

          .
        </p>
        <h5>English as a Safe Space</h5>
        <p>
          Queerphobic attitudes lead to a necessity for safe spaces. It’s been
          observed in
          <a
            href="https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p071423"
            target="_blank"

            {" "}
            several studies{" "}
          </a>
          that queer people tend to use English in order to build what we might
          call a “linguistic safe space”.
        </p>
        <p>
          The appropriation of English by queer communities involves countries
          like
          <a
            href="https://books.google.nl/books?hl=en&lr=&id=lbMUxRiQO6sC&oi=fnd&pg=PA105&dq=moriel+israel+disco&ots=oj6Gqb6Hun&sig=zBl_76aEXmDoJoG7Jq-u8YlnZ3M&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=moriel%20israel%20disco&f=false"

            {" "}
            Israel{" "}
          </a>
          where local language(s) don’t allow escaping the gender binary due to
          their grammatical constraints. In this case, English can be perceived
          as a safe space since it allows for gender neutrality.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, Mongolia provides an interesting scenario, as the
          importance of the use of English on Facebook is shown by Associate
          Professor Dovchin to be an important component of the contemporary gay
          Mongolian identity. A participant in
          <a
            href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/weng.12445"
            target="_blank"
          >
            {" "}
            the study{" "}
          </a>
          described the feeling of having found a safe space as “using English
          is more natural and easier for me than using Mongolian because it
          gives me the freedom I have always been searching for”.
        </p>
        <h5>Transnational Connections through English</h5>
        <p>
          Even outside of the virtual world, English is a tool for transnational
          connections. Among
          <a
            href="https://books.google.nl/books?hl=en&lr=&id=lbMUxRiQO6sC&oi=fnd&pg=PA105&dq=moriel+israel+disco&ots=oj6Gqb6Hun&sig=zBl_76aEXmDoJoG7Jq-u8YlnZ3M&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=moriel%20israel%20disco&f=false"
            target="_blank"
          >
            {" "}
            queer Israelis
          </a>
          , English is thought of as a way to engage with like-minded people and
          take part in a global conversation. Similarly, during the late 70s and
          80s in Hong Kong, only a small proportion of the population spoke
          English fluently, regarding it as the
          <a
            href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/weng.12005"
            target="_blank"
          >
            {" "}
            language of foreigners
          </a>
          . Thus, the reason to learn English for many LGBTQ+ people at the time
          was mainly to provide a gateway to a more liberal Western culture and
          finding a foreign partner in order to escape the restrictions of their
          society. In other words, it allows for a sense of inclusion and
          cosmopolitanism by enabling people to express their identities in a
          way that transcends regional linguistic and cultural boundaries.
        </p>
        <h5>The English Queer Creole</h5>
        <p>
          When LGBTQ+ people use English, they often exhibit creativity by
          either integrating it into their language or assigning novel meanings
          to existing words. An example of the former is
          <a
            href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/weng.12445"
            target="_blank"
          >
            {" "}
            the way gay Mongolian men use a word like “emotion”
          </a>
          , ‘cut’ it into “emo-” then add the suffix “-rood” (to become),
          forming emorood, which means “to become extremely emotional”.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the
          <a
            href="https://www.cairn.info/revue-autrepart-2009-1-page-15.htm"
            target="_blank"
          >
            {" "}
            Thai gay community
          </a>
          , queer concepts like “top” and “bottom” are expressed with English
          words “(gay) king” and “(gay) queen”, in a way that is not
          understandable by speakers of English. Likewise, the lesbian community
          uses the words tom and dee, respectively from “tomboy” and “lady” to
          express the pair “butch/femme”.
        </p>
        <p>
          As another example, within Israel's LGBTQ+ culture, there is a process
          of creolisation involving the blending of gay English, vernacular
          Hebrew, and Arabic, resulting in the creation of a unique local lingo
          that often retains the Hebrew grammatical features. For instance,
          <a
            href="https://books.google.nl/books?hl=en&lr=&id=lbMUxRiQO6sC&oi=fnd&pg=PA105&dq=moriel+israel+disco&ots=oj6Gqb6Hun&sig=zBl_76aEXmDoJoG7Jq-u8YlnZ3M&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=moriel%20israel%20disco&f=false"
            target="_blank"
          >
            {" "}
            in lesbian circles one is either “butch-eet” or “femme-eet”
            {" "}
          </a>
          originating from the English words in adaptation with the Hebrew
          feminine ending.
        </p>
        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p>
          For historically marginalised communities such as the LGBTQ+ one,
          English has adapted in multiple ways as a gateway to authentic
          expressions of queer identities. Queer cultures across the world, with
          their own unique characters, have found diverse ways to address the
          need for linguistic safe spaces, showing agency and creativity in
          their struggle for liberation.
